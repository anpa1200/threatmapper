# Export A PDF Report: AdversaryGraph Use Case

**Level:** Simple  
**Goal:** Create a shareable analyst report from reviewed findings.

## Why This Use Case Matters

Create a shareable analyst report from reviewed findings. In real CTI and SOC work, the value is not only the result. The value is the repeatable path from input to reviewed output. AdversaryGraph keeps report analysis, ATT&CK mapping, actor context, IOC enrichment, and exportable evidence in one workflow.

## Workflow

1. **Open a reviewed analysis or report view.**
2. **Click PDF export and verify the included TTPs, evidence, and notes.**


## Expected Output

PDF report for handoff or briefing.

## Analyst Review Standard

- Keep source evidence and source labels attached.
- Mark uncertain findings as `needs-evidence` instead of forcing a conclusion.
- Do not treat TTP similarity as attribution by itself.
- Use enrichment as context, not as an automatic decision.
- Export only reviewed findings.

## Where This Fits

This use case can support CTI production, SOC triage, threat hunting, detection engineering, customer reporting, or platform validation depending on the workflow level.
