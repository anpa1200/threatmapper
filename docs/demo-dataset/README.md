# Demo Dataset

This directory contains a deterministic demo dataset for evaluating AdversaryGraph without private or confidential data.

## Files

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `public-report-excerpt.md` | Excerpt from a synthetic public threat report — safe to run through the ATT&CK extraction pipeline |
| `expected-mappings.json` | Expected ATT&CK technique mappings for the report excerpt — use to verify extraction accuracy |

## How to use

1. Start AdversaryGraph with `docker compose up`
2. Upload `public-report-excerpt.md` through the web UI or API
3. Run AI analysis to extract ATT&CK mappings
4. Compare extracted techniques against `expected-mappings.json`

The demo dataset is designed so that reasonable AI extraction produces at least 70% overlap with the expected mappings. Exact match rates vary by LLM provider and model.

## Notes

- This dataset contains no real threat intelligence, no real IOCs, and no real victim or adversary names
- The report text is synthetic and safe for sharing publicly
- Do not use this dataset to evaluate production detection coverage
