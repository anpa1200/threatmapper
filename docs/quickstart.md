# Quickstart

This guide starts a local ThreatMapper Docker deployment for evaluation.

## Prerequisites

- Docker Engine and Docker Compose v2.
- 8 GB RAM available to Docker.
- At least one LLM provider key for AI report extraction.

The public browser workspace at <https://1200km.com/threat-matrix/> does not require Docker, but it also does not process private reports or store backend analyses.

## 1. Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anpa1200/threatmapper.git
cd threatmapper
```

## 2. Configure

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and set at least one provider key:

```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
OPENAI_API_KEY=
GEMINI_API_KEY=
```

For private analysis, use an operator-controlled LLM gateway and review the provider's data-retention terms.

## 3. Start

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

First startup ingests MITRE ATT&CK STIX data into PostgreSQL. This can take several minutes.

## 4. Open

| Service | URL |
|---|---|
| Frontend | http://localhost:3000 |
| API docs | http://localhost:8000/docs |
| Health | http://localhost:8000/api/health |
| Anomaly Detection Atlas | http://localhost:3001/anomaly-detection-atlas/ |

## 5. Smoke Test

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/attack/versions"
```

Expected health response:

```json
{"status":"ok","version":"0.9.0"}
```

## Troubleshooting: PostgreSQL Password Mismatch

If the API exits during startup with:

```text
asyncpg.exceptions.InvalidPasswordError: password authentication failed for user "tm_user"
```

the PostgreSQL volume was probably created with an older `DB_PASS`. Docker does
not reinitialize an existing database volume when `.env` changes.

This does not affect a fresh clone on a new machine when `.env` is created
before the first `docker compose up --build`. In that case, PostgreSQL
initializes the new volume with the current `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, and `DB_PASS`
values.

For a development deployment where you can discard local database state, reset
the volumes:

```bash
docker compose down -v
docker compose up --build
```

To keep the existing database, update the stored PostgreSQL role password to
match the current `.env`:

```bash
docker compose exec -T postgres sh -lc 'psql -U "$POSTGRES_USER" -d "$POSTGRES_DB" -v pass="$POSTGRES_PASSWORD" <<'"'"'SQL'"'"'
ALTER USER tm_user WITH PASSWORD :'"'"'pass'"'"';
SQL'
docker compose restart api worker beat frontend
```

## 6. Demo Workflow

1. Open the frontend.
2. Select Enterprise ATT&CK.
3. Paste a public CTI excerpt from `docs/demo-dataset/public-report-excerpt.md`.
4. Run analysis with the configured provider.
5. Review the extracted techniques.
6. Compare against known groups and campaigns.
7. Export a Navigator layer, JSON report, or PDF report.

Do not use confidential reports in public or third-party environments.
