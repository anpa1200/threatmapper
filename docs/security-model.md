# Security Model

AdversaryGraph is a self-hosted analyst workbench, not a managed SaaS.

## Trust Boundaries

| Boundary | Trust Assumption |
|---|---|
| Browser to frontend | User has access to the workspace |
| Frontend to API | API is reachable from the operator-controlled network |
| API to PostgreSQL | Database is private to the deployment |
| API/worker to LLM provider | Operator controls provider choice and accepts provider data terms |
| API to MITRE/GitHub | Public ATT&CK STIX bundles are downloaded for sync |
| API to IOC feeds | Operator controls ThreatFox, OTX, and custom feed credentials/URLs |
| AdversaryGraph to malware-analysis service | Malware samples remain outside the main application containers; only validated result artifacts are imported |
| Malware-analysis service to sandbox | Dynamic execution is allowed only in disposable isolated sandbox profiles, not in normal application containers |

## Sensitive Data

Potentially sensitive data includes:

- Uploaded reports.
- Uploaded malware archives and extracted samples, if the optional malware-analysis service is enabled.
- Extracted text from reports.
- Malware-analysis artifacts such as strings, PCAPs, memory metadata, debugger notes, and unpacked payloads.
- LLM raw responses.
- Analyst notes.
- Campaign or customer names.
- IOC feed contents and actor-linked indicators.
- Custom feed URLs.
- Exported PDF/JSON reports.
- API keys.

## Public Workspace

The public web workspace is for exploration. It should not receive:

- Customer reports.
- Internal incident data.
- Classified or restricted data.
- Credentials.
- Private victim details.

## Self-Hosted Workspace

For private analysis:

- Deploy locally or inside a trusted network.
- Use non-default database credentials.
- Use private LLM infrastructure if provider transmission is not acceptable.
- Restrict access through a reverse proxy.
- Configure `AUTH_ENABLED=true` and `PROXY_SECRET` when using trusted-header
  authentication. The proxy must strip client-supplied `X-Auth-User`,
  `X-Auth-Roles`, and `X-Internal-Proxy-Secret` headers before setting trusted
  identity headers.
- Set explicit `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`; wildcard origins are rejected when
  credentialed API access is enabled.
- Back up and purge data according to local policy.

## LLM Output

LLM output is treated as untrusted:

- Mappings require analyst review.
- Similarity scores are investigation leads.
- Generated detection logic is draft material.
- Exports should include limitations when used in a report.

## File Parsing

AdversaryGraph supports text, PDF, and DOCX extraction. Operators should treat uploaded documents as untrusted and run the platform in a controlled environment.

## Malware Analysis

The integrated MalwareGraph malware-analysis capability has a separate architecture because
malware samples are more dangerous than ordinary report uploads. The main
AdversaryGraph containers should not receive, extract, execute, or debug malware
directly.

Required security posture:

- keep malware archives, extracted payloads, memory dumps, and packet captures in
  a dedicated malware-analysis service and artifact store;
- default to static-only analysis with no sample execution;
- use non-root, read-only, capability-dropped containers for intake and static
  workers;
- deny outbound network access from analysis workers unless a specific
  enrichment worker is allowlisted;
- run dynamic execution, debugging, or memory-unpacking only in disposable VM,
  microVM, or dedicated sandbox profiles;
- route dynamic network behavior to fake internet or sinkhole services by
  default, not to production networks;
- do not submit binaries to third-party services unless an operator policy and
  analyst approval explicitly allow it;
- import only validated `analysis.json` results and derived artifacts into the
  AdversaryGraph investigation graph.

See [Malware Analysis Architecture](malware-analysis-architecture.md) for the
full scenario, container model, pipeline stages, and safety controls.

## IOC Feeds

IOC feeds are operational data, not stable reference data. Operators should:

- keep ThreatFox/OTX keys out of commits and screenshots;
- review custom feed provenance before import;
- expect server-side feed fetches to reject localhost, private, link-local,
  multicast, reserved, and cloud-metadata destinations as SSRF protection;
- avoid importing customer-private feeds into public demos;
- define retention and export rules for actor IOC CSVs;
- treat extracted IOCs from uploaded reports as untrusted until reviewed.
