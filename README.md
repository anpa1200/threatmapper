## Short Installation Guide

Use this path for a fresh local Docker deployment.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anpa1200/adversarygraph.git
cd adversarygraph
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and set at least one LLM provider:

```env
# Cloud provider example
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
MINIMAX_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Or local OpenAI-compatible endpoint
LOCAL_LLM_BASE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:11434/v1
LOCAL_LLM_API_KEY=local
LOCAL_LLM_MODEL=llama3.1:8b
```

Optional enrichment keys and feed sync:

```env
# abuse.ch ThreatFox IOC sync
THREATFOX_AUTH_KEY=your_abuse_ch_auth_key
AUTO_IOC_FULL_SYNC_ON_STARTUP=true
AUTO_THREATFOX_SYNC_DAYS=7

# AlienVault OTX actor-attributed pulse enrichment
OTX_API_KEY=your_otx_key

# VirusTotal on-demand IOC reputation and relationship lookup
VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY=your_virustotal_key

# Optional IOC Investigation pivots
URLSCAN_API_KEY=your_urlscan_key
# GreyNoise Community is used by default; no key is needed for baseline lookup.
GREYNOISE_API_KEY=
SHODAN_API_KEY=your_shodan_key
ABUSEIPDB_API_KEY=your_abuseipdb_key
CENSYS_API_KEY=your_censys_platform_pat
CENSYS_ORG_ID=optional_censys_org_id

# OpenCTI symmetric sync
OPENCTI_URL=https://opencti.example.com
OPENCTI_TOKEN=your_opencti_token
OPENCTI_SYNC_LIMIT=500
OPENCTI_VERIFY_TLS=true

# Daily dynamic DB refresh schedule in UTC
DYNAMIC_DB_SYNC_HOUR=3
DYNAMIC_DB_SYNC_MINUTE=30
DYNAMIC_DB_IOC_SYNC_DAYS=7
```

No key is required for MITRE ATT&CK/ATLAS sync, built-in public MISP Galaxy metadata sync, Malpedia, GreyNoise Community lookup, or public urlscan lookups within provider limits. MISP JSON exports, STIX/TAXII collection URLs, custom JSON/CSV/TXT feeds, Sigma/YARA feeds, and sandbox behavior feeds are connected from the UI or API as source URLs/tokens. OpenCTI sync needs an OpenCTI API token with read access to indicators, observables, reports, and labels, plus create/update access for indicators and reports. Keep filled `.env` files private.

Start the stack:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Open:

- Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
- API health: `http://localhost:8000/api/health`
- API docs: `http://localhost:8000/docs`

Run the built-in health checks:

```bash
./scripts/selftest.sh
```

On first startup, AdversaryGraph downloads and ingests MITRE ATT&CK / ATLAS reference data. The first sync can take a few minutes.

## From Log to Report Workflow

AdversaryGraph documents the practical workflow for turning firewall logs, EDR
events, proxy records, PCAP-derived text, suspicious commands, and raw IOC lists
into a structured CTI investigation:

1. Create a new Investigation workspace.
2. Paste operational telemetry into AI Analysis.
3. Extract IOCs, suspicious commands, PowerShell, hashes, domains, URLs, and
   ATT&CK technique leads.
4. Add the AI analysis result to the active investigation.
5. Investigate extracted IOCs through Tier 1 / Tier 2 / Tier 3 pivots.
6. Add useful IOC Investigation results to the same investigation.
7. Review source evidence, relationship graph nodes, actor leads, source
   conflicts, kill-chain coverage, and TTP leads.
8. Create a Navigator-like layer from investigation TTPs and send it to the matrix.
9. Compare the TTP layer with threat actors and save the result to the investigation.
10. Summarize the investigation with AI.
11. Generate a local or AI-assisted report for analyst handoff.

The complete public walkthrough is mirrored in the 1200km ecosystem:

## Malware Analysis Mode

AdversaryGraph v4 includes an integrated Malware Analysis workspace backed by a
separate MalwareGraph service in the same Docker Compose stack. The workflow is
case-based: create a malware-analysis case, upload a raw sample or
password-protected ZIP, run first-pass static triage, and collect extracted IOCs,
TTPs, strings, artifacts, files, behaviors, unpack layers, debug findings, and AI
analysis leads into one AdversaryGraph-linked case view.

Current malware-analysis pages include:

- **First Analysis** - file type, magic bytes, entropy, packed/obfuscated
  signals, packer hints, hashes, and PE-header triage.
- **Unpacker** - packer detection, safe unpack attempts, output validation,
  AI-assisted packer analysis, and saving unpacked artifacts back to the case.
- **Strings** - full string extraction, smart IOC/API/registry/command
  categorization, optional AI string analysis, and clickable IOC/TTP links.
- **Decompilation and Debug** - IDE-style decompilation/debug workspace for
  functions, pseudo-code, registers, memory views, breakpoints, and step plans.
- **Dynamic Analysis** - isolated runtime workflow planning and gated dynamic
  debugging controls for disposable, network-isolated environments only.

Every extracted hash, IP, domain, URL, file, registry key, behavior, and ATT&CK
technique lead is designed to be clickable into the existing AdversaryGraph IOC,
Navigator, VirusTotal, and investigation workflows. Runtime execution and live
debugging remain disabled by default and require an explicitly isolated
MalwareGraph runtime profile.

## Public Demo Privacy Note

The public Web workspace is intended for exploration. Do not upload confidential, customer-sensitive, classified, or internal reports into public demos or third-party environments. Use the self-hosted Docker deployment for private analysis.

## Validation and Limitations

AdversaryGraph assists analysts but does not replace analyst validation. LLM-generated ATT&CK mappings may include false positives, false negatives, or ambiguous technique assignments. Group and campaign similarity is based on TTP overlap and should be treated as an investigation lead, not attribution proof.

## Architecture

## Web vs Docker

**AdversaryGraph Web** is the public browser-native workspace for ATT&CK exploration, manual layers, group overlays and comparisons, local workspaces, ecosystem research, coverage-gap analysis, and browser-generated exports. It does not perform LLM report extraction or backend private-report storage.

**AdversaryGraph Docker** is the full self-hosted platform for provider-configured AI extraction, private PostgreSQL-backed analyses, campaigns, APIs, PDF reports, detection-rule workflows, and scheduled ATT&CK synchronization.

AdversaryGraph is self-hosted. In Docker mode, report content is sent only to the LLM provider configured by the operator. For fully private analysis, use a local or private LLM gateway. The public Web workspace does not perform LLM report extraction or backend report storage.

The malware-analysis capability uses a separate isolated MalwareGraph analysis
service in the same Docker Compose stack, but the analyst experience is a native AdversaryGraph dashboard. Every
extracted hash, IP, domain, URL, behavior, TTP, detection, malware-family lead,
and actor-similarity lead becomes clickable graph-linked data that pivots into
IOC Intelligence, ATT&CK Navigator, Compare Groups, Detection Studio, evidence
views, and exports. Malware archives and extracted samples stay out of the main
application containers, and the default workflow is static-only. Any execution,
debugging, or dynamic unpacking must run in a disposable sandbox boundary with
fake-internet or restricted network controls. See [Malware Analysis Module](docs/malware-analysis-module.md)
and [Malware Analysis Architecture](docs/malware-analysis-architecture.md).

The Docker deployment gives the operator control over storage, networking, and provider configuration. Trusted-header authentication and roles are available when configured, but internet-facing deployments still require TLS, an authenticating reverse proxy, restricted network exposure, backups, retention controls, and secrets management.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker + Docker Compose (v2)
- API key for at least one cloud LLM provider, or a local OpenAI-compatible LLM endpoint

### 1 — Clone and configure

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anpa1200/adversarygraph.git
cd adversarygraph
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your API keys:

```env
# Optional cloud providers
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4.1
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIza...
MINIMAX_API_KEY=sk-...
MINIMAX_MODEL=MiniMax-M3
MINIMAX_BASE_URL=https://api.minimax.io/v1

# Optional local provider: Ollama / LM Studio / LocalAI / vLLM with OpenAI-compatible API
LOCAL_LLM_BASE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:11434/v1
LOCAL_LLM_API_KEY=local
LOCAL_LLM_MODEL=llama3.1:8b

# Database and internal services
DB_NAME=adversarygraph
DB_USER=ag_user
DB_PASS=changeme_strong_password
REDIS_PASSWORD=changeme_redis
ADVERSARYGRAPH_DB_DIR=./data/postgres

# Browser origins allowed to call the API
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000

# Optional trusted-header authentication behind a hardened reverse proxy
AUTH_ENABLED=false
AUTH_DEFAULT_ROLE=viewer
PROXY_SECRET=

# ATT&CK / ATLAS domains to ingest (comma-separated)
ATTCK_DOMAINS=enterprise-attack,mobile-attack,ics-attack,atlas

# IOC enrichment and feed sync (optional)
THREATFOX_AUTH_KEY=your_abuse_ch_auth_key
AUTO_IOC_FULL_SYNC_ON_STARTUP=true
AUTO_THREATFOX_SYNC_DAYS=7
OTX_API_KEY=your_otx_key
VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY=your_virustotal_key
OPENCTI_URL=https://opencti.example.com
OPENCTI_TOKEN=your_opencti_token
OPENCTI_SYNC_LIMIT=500
OPENCTI_VERIFY_TLS=true
DYNAMIC_DB_SYNC_HOUR=3
DYNAMIC_DB_SYNC_MINUTE=30
DYNAMIC_DB_IOC_SYNC_DAYS=7

LOG_LEVEL=info
```

> You only need one working provider. Cloud API keys can be left blank if you use the local provider.
>
> Enrichment keys are optional. `AUTO_IOC_FULL_SYNC_ON_STARTUP=true` starts a non-blocking IOC source sync after API startup for ThreatFox, Malpedia, OTX, and enabled custom feeds. `THREATFOX_AUTH_KEY` enables abuse.ch ThreatFox IOC sync, `OTX_API_KEY` enables AlienVault OTX pulse enrichment, `VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY` enables on-demand IOC reputation and relationship lookup, and `OPENCTI_URL` plus `OPENCTI_TOKEN` enables OpenCTI pull/push/bidirectional sync. MITRE ATT&CK/ATLAS and public MISP Galaxy sync do not require API keys. MISP JSON exports, STIX/TAXII URLs, custom JSON/CSV/TXT feeds, Sigma/YARA feeds, and sandbox behavior feeds are configured later from the UI/API as source URLs or tokens.
>
> **You must create `.env` before running `docker compose up`.** Without it, cloud API keys are empty and local-provider defaults are used.
>
> PostgreSQL stores data in `ADVERSARYGRAPH_DB_DIR` (`./data/postgres` by
> default). This folder is created on first deployment and is outside the
> container lifecycle. Keep it when rebuilding containers; it contains private
> report sessions, private/custom IOCs, custom feeds, and the current synced
> public reference database.
>
> Existing deployments that still use the older Docker-managed `pg_data` volume
> can migrate once:
>
> ```bash
> ./scripts/migrate-postgres-volume-to-external-dir.sh
> docker compose up -d
> ```
>
> PostgreSQL uses `.env` credentials when the database directory is first created.
> If `DB_PASS` changes after a volume already exists, apply the new password
> without deleting data:
>
> ```bash
> docker compose --profile tools run --rm db-apply-env-creds
> docker compose up -d --force-recreate api worker beat frontend
> ```

For Ollama on the same host:

```bash
ollama pull llama3.1:8b
ollama serve
```

Keep:

```env
LOCAL_LLM_BASE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:11434/v1
LOCAL_LLM_MODEL=llama3.1:8b
```

For LM Studio, start its local OpenAI-compatible server and use:

```env
LOCAL_LLM_BASE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:1234/v1
LOCAL_LLM_MODEL=<model-name-shown-by-LM-Studio>
```

### 2 — Start

```bash
docker compose up
```

**First startup takes 5–15 minutes.** The API container automatically:
1. Runs `create_tables()` to initialise the PostgreSQL schema
2. Downloads the latest ATT&CK STIX bundles and the MITRE ATLAS STIX bundle from GitHub
3. Parses the STIX 2.1 JSON directly (no third-party ATT&CK library — Python 3.12 compatible)
4. Upserts tactics, techniques, groups, campaigns, and all relationships into PostgreSQL. ATLAS currently contributes matrix/tactic/technique data; MITRE's ATLAS bundle does not publish APT group profiles.

The `atlas-builder` container builds the embedded reference-book snapshot immediately,
then synchronizes it with the standalone Anomaly Detection Atlas repository every hour.
Set `ATLAS_SYNC_INTERVAL=0` to disable remote synchronization. Run `make sync-atlas`
to import unpushed changes from a local sibling `anomaly-detection-atlas` checkout.

Watch progress:

```bash
docker compose logs -f api
```

Expected output (v19.1):

```

## Usage Guide

### Navigator

The central workspace. The full ATT&CK matrix renders as a colour-coded heatmap.

#### Basic interaction

| Action | How |
|---|---|
| Zoom / pan | Scroll to zoom, drag to pan. Double-click resets view. |
| Select a technique | Click any cell — turns red, added to your TTP layer |
| Expand sub-techniques | Click the ▶ arrow on any parent cell |
| Open detail panel | Click a cell to open the right-side panel (full description, detection notes, data sources, exact reference paragraphs, AI assistant) |
| Search | Type in the search box to filter by name or ATT&CK ID |
| Filter by platform | Use the platform dropdown (Windows, Linux, macOS, Cloud, etc.) |
| Filter by tactic | Use the tactic dropdown to focus on a specific kill-chain phase |

#### Layer toolbar

| Button | Action |
|---|---|
| ↑ Import layer | Load an existing ATT&CK Navigator `.json` layer |
| ↓ Navigator layer | Export your TTPs + overlay as ATT&CK Navigator JSON |
| ↓ PDF | Export current layer as a formatted PDF report |
| Expand all / Collapse all | Toggle sub-technique visibility |
| Clear my TTPs | Reset your selection |
| Clear overlay | Remove the group-profile overlay |

#### Colour coding

| Colour | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Red `#e94560` | In your TTP layer |
| Blue `#3b82f6` | In the group-profile overlay only |
| Amber `#f59e0b` | In both layers (shared TTPs) |
| Dark | Not selected |

#### AI Assistant

Click any technique to open the detail panel with an embedded chat. The full ATT&CK description for the selected technique is already in context. Example prompts:

- *"What are the most common detections for this technique?"*
- *"Write a SIGMA rule skeleton for T1059.001"*
- *"What ATT&CK groups use this in combination with lateral movement?"*

### Reference Book and Exact TTP Crosslinks

AdversaryGraph integrates the complete Anomaly Detection Atlas as an autonomous Docker service.
Click **Reference Book** in the sidebar to open the full documentation site.

Each matrix technique panel loads `ttp-reference-index.json` and shows links only to exact matching
paragraphs or table rows. A technique can link to multiple relevant activity descriptions, basic
detection rules, and statistical-anomaly mappings. The links use stable generated anchors such as:

```text
http://localhost:3001/anomaly-detection-atlas/attack-basic-detection-rule-catalog/#ttp-t1059-001
http://localhost:3001/anomaly-detection-atlas/attack-statistical-anomaly-mapping/#ttp-t1030
```

The embedded snapshot makes the book usable without a successful remote synchronization. The
`atlas-builder` service checks the standalone atlas repository every hour, regenerates exact TTP
anchors and the crosslink index, then atomically publishes the updated Docusaurus build.

Manual local synchronization:

```bash
make sync-atlas
docker compose up -d --build atlas-builder atlas-docs frontend
```

---

### AI Analysis

Analyse threat intelligence documents and automatically map every observable behaviour to ATT&CK. Each completed analysis is saved to the **Reports Library (DB 2)**.

#### Step-by-step

1. Click **Analyze** in the sidebar
2. Select an LLM provider and optionally specify a model
3. Choose a domain (`enterprise-attack`, `mobile-attack`, or `ics-attack`)
4. Optionally enter a **name** for this analysis (shown in the Reports Library later)
5. Either paste text or upload a file (PDF, DOCX, TXT — up to 50 MB)
6. Click **Analyse with AI**
7. Watch the live SSE token stream as the model thinks
8. Review the three tabs:

| Tab | Content |
|---|---|
| **Techniques** | ATT&CK technique mappings with confidence score, tactic, and evidence snippet |
| **Group Similarity Leads** | Top group profiles ranked by Jaccard TTP overlap |
| **Raw Response** | Full LLM JSON output for debugging |

9. Click **→ Inject into Navigator** to push all extracted techniques into your layer

#### Confidence score guide

| Score | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 90–100 % | Explicitly stated in the text |
| 70–89 % | Strongly implied |
| 40–69 % | Weakly implied or inferred from context |
| < 40 % | Speculative — treat with caution |

#### Supported file types

| Type | Notes |
|---|---|
| `.pdf` | Text extraction via PyMuPDF |
| `.docx` | Paragraphs and table cells extracted via python-docx |
| `.txt` / plain text | UTF-8, latin-1, CP1252 auto-detected |

Files are truncated at 120,000 characters before being sent to the LLM.

---

### ATT&CK Group Library

Browse the threat groups in the currently ingested ATT&CK release. Each group has two tabs:

#### Techniques tab

- All known techniques with ATT&CK IDs, tactic, and use description
- **Add all to my TTPs** — bulk-load every technique into your Navigator layer
- **Overlay on Navigator** — show the group's TTPs as a blue overlay on the matrix

#### Campaigns tab (DB 1)

Named operations attributed to this group, parsed from MITRE ATT&CK STIX data.

Each campaign card shows:
- ATT&CK campaign ID (e.g. C0024), name, and date range
- Technique count for that specific operation
- Expand to see the full technique list with tactic tags
- **Add to my TTPs** — load this campaign's specific TTP fingerprint into Navigator

> **Why campaigns matter:** A group's aggregate profile is the union of all operations over years. A campaign profile is specific to one attack. Matching against C0024 (SolarWinds Compromise) at 45% similarity is a more specific lead than matching against G0016 (APT29) at 15%.

---

### Compare

Rank ATT&CK groups and campaigns against your TTPs using Jaccard similarity.

**Jaccard similarity** = `|shared techniques| / |union of all techniques|`

Use the **mode switcher** at the top of the Compare page to choose what to compare against:

#### Mode: Groups (DB 1)

Rank every ATT&CK group against your current Navigator selection.

| Detail tab | Content |
|---|---|
| **Overview** | Similarity score, shared techniques (amber chips), your-only techniques |
| **Tactic Breakdown** | Stacked bar per kill-chain phase: shared / user-only / group-profile-only |
| **Visual Diff** | Compact matrix colour-strip showing the full overlap |
| **Gap Analysis** | Every technique in the group's profile not in your layer — your detection backlog |

**Actions:**
- **Overlay in Navigator** — visualise the overlap on the full matrix
- **↓ PDF Report** — export a formatted comparison report

#### Mode: Campaigns (DB 1)

Rank named campaigns from the currently ingested ATT&CK release against your current Navigator selection.

The detail panel shows:
- Similarity score, shared techniques highlighted in purple
- Full campaign technique list with overlap indicators
- Attribution (which group conducted this campaign)
- Date range of the campaign

#### Mode: Reports (DB 2)

Browse your stored AI analysis sessions. Click any report body to see which group and campaign profiles have the strongest TTP overlap with its extracted profile — without re-running the expensive LLM call.

Use cases:
- **Retrospective TTP-overlap review** after a new ATT&CK version is released
- **Cross-incident correlation** across multiple saved reports
- **Environmental profiling** — which groups keep appearing across your incident set

**Per-session actions:**
- **↓ PDF** — download the full analysis PDF for that session at any time
- **↓ STIX/OpenCTI** — download a STIX 2.1 bundle containing the report, ATT&CK attack-patterns, and similarity-lead intrusion sets for OpenCTI import
- **✕ Remove** — delete the session from DB 2 (browser confirm required; list refreshes automatically)

---

### Export

#### Analysis PDF

From **Analyze**, click **Download PDF** on any completed analysis. Includes:
- Cover page with provider, model, domain, session ID, timestamp
- Executive summary (AI-generated)
- Extracted techniques table sorted by confidence
- Group-similarity section with top Jaccard-overlap leads
- Tactic coverage breakdown

#### STIX 2.1 / OpenCTI Export

From **Analyze**, click **↓ STIX/OpenCTI** on a completed analysis to download a
STIX 2.1 bundle. The bundle is designed for OpenCTI import and contains:

- a STIX `report` for the AdversaryGraph analysis session
- ATT&CK `attack-pattern` objects for extracted TTPs
- optional `intrusion-set` objects for group-similarity leads
- AdversaryGraph custom metadata for confidence, review status, evidence source, similarity score, model, provider, and ATT&CK domain

AdversaryGraph does not export IOCs here. Group matches are exported as
TTP-overlap investigation leads, not attribution claims.

#### Navigator layer PDF

From **Navigator**, click **↓ PDF** in the toolbar. Lists all techniques in your current layer with tactics and platforms.

#### ATT&CK Navigator JSON

Click **↓ Navigator layer** to download a `.json` file compatible with [MITRE ATT&CK Navigator](https://mitre-attack.github.io/attack-navigator/).

---

### MITRE Sync

AdversaryGraph tracks new ATT&CK releases automatically.

#### Automatic sync (daily)

A Celery Beat scheduler runs `check_and_sync` every day at 03:00 UTC. It queries MITRE's GitHub repository for new bundle versions and ingests updates without downtime.

#### Staleness indicator

The sidebar footer shows:
- **Green dot** — all domains are on the latest version
- **Amber pulse** — at least one domain has a newer version available

#### Manual sync

```bash
# Via API
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/sync/trigger

# Check status
curl http://localhost:8000/api/sync/status
```

---

## Two-Database Architecture

### DB 1 — MITRE ATT&CK (read-only reference data)

Populated from MITRE's official STIX 2.1 bundles on startup and on each sync. Contains:

- **Groups** — named threat actors with aggregate TTP profiles from the ingested release
- **Campaigns** — named operations with per-operation TTP profiles from the ingested release
- **Attribution links** — which group conducted which campaign (`attributed-to` relationships)
- **Technique usage** — the specific techniques observed in each group/campaign with use descriptions

Built on the currently ingested MITRE ATT&CK and MITRE ATLAS datasets. Counts depend on the selected domain and source release.

| Domain | Groups | Campaigns | Techniques |
|---|---|---|---|
| Enterprise | Dynamic | Dynamic | Dynamic |
| ICS | Dynamic | Dynamic | Dynamic |
| Mobile | Dynamic | Dynamic | Dynamic |
| ATLAS | N/A from upstream | N/A from upstream | Dynamic |

### DB 2 — User Report Sessions (append-only)

Created by every AI Analysis you run. Each session stores:

- `name` — the label you gave when uploading (or the filename)
- `domain` — which ATT&CK domain was used
- `provider` / `model` — which LLM was used
- `extracted_techniques` — JSON array of `{attack_id, name, tactic, confidence, evidence}`
- `apt_matches` — JSON array of the Jaccard ranking computed at analysis time
- `summary` — the AI-generated summary
- `status` — `processing` / `completed` / `failed`

Sessions in DB 2 can be re-compared at any time via `POST /api/analyze/sessions/{id}/compare` — this re-runs Jaccard against the *current* DB 1 (useful after a new ATT&CK version has been ingested).

### Sector Intelligence DB — Actor Relevance Evidence

AdversaryGraph stores feed-backed actor relevance observations locally so scoring
does not depend on live source availability at query time.

Initial v3 MVP source:

- **MISP Galaxy threat actors** — actor aliases, targeted sectors, CFR target
  categories, suspected victim geographies, origin metadata, motivation, and refs.
- **MITRE ATT&CK campaigns** — campaign first/last seen dates and actor links for
  recency scoring.

The Sector Intel page lets you sync MISP Galaxy and rank actors for a client context:

```text
sector + region + environment keywords + activity window
  -> relevant actors
  -> reasons
  -> evidence links
  -> ATT&CK TTP depth
```

API:

```text
GET  /api/sector/sources
POST /api/sector/sync/misp-galaxy
GET  /api/sector/sectors
GET  /api/sector/relevance?sectors=telecom&regions=Israel&days=365
```

### IOC Intelligence DB — Actor Observables

AdversaryGraph stores source-backed indicators locally and links them to actors only
when there is explicit evidence. ATT&CK itself does not provide live IOCs.

Supported initial sources:

- **Startup IOC sync** — when `AUTO_IOC_FULL_SYNC_ON_STARTUP=true`, AdversaryGraph
  starts a non-blocking full IOC source sync after API startup for ThreatFox,
  Malpedia, OTX, and enabled custom feeds. Missing optional API keys are reported
  per source and do not block the application.
- **abuse.ch ThreatFox** — current malware-related IOCs. Set
  `THREATFOX_AUTH_KEY` in `.env` before syncing. The recent IOC API supports
  1-7 day windows; use ThreatFox exports or custom feeds for larger windows.
- **AlienVault OTX** — actor-attributed pulse search. Set `OTX_API_KEY` in
  `.env`; AdversaryGraph searches ATT&CK actor names/aliases, imports pulse
  indicators, and links them when pulse adversary/title/tags match the actor.
- **Malpedia** — public malware-family metadata and actor attribution. This
  adds `malware-family` enrichment records with family aliases, references,
  attribution evidence, and actor links when Malpedia names match ATT&CK actor
  names or aliases. No API key is required for the public family metadata sync.
- **IOC Investigation pivots** — on-demand Tier 1 / Tier 2 / Tier 3 enrichment can query
  VirusTotal, ThreatFox, MalwareBazaar, OTX, urlscan.io, GreyNoise, AbuseIPDB,
  Shodan, Censys, and the local IOC database. Missing optional provider keys
  are shown as source-level status, not as platform failure.
- **Custom / personal IOC feeds** — private JSON, CSV, or TXT feeds registered
  from the IOC Library, actor IOC tab, or API.
- **MISP JSON exports** — connect a MISP event/attribute export URL as a custom
  JSON IOC feed. Full MISP server authentication is intentionally not embedded;
  use a local gateway or export URL that returns JSON to the AdversaryGraph
  container.
- **STIX 2.1 / TAXII** — export filtered IOC Library records as STIX 2.1,
  import STIX bundles, or pull a TAXII 2.1 collection objects URL into the
  local IOC database.
- **OpenCTI symmetric sync** — set `OPENCTI_URL` and `OPENCTI_TOKEN`, then use
  Feeds Management to pull OpenCTI indicators, observables, labels, and reports
  into AdversaryGraph or push local IOCs and completed reports back to OpenCTI.
- **Manual report import** — JSON import for report, MISP, OpenCTI, or vendor CTI
  extracts where the actor mapping is already known.

Actor IOC tabs show:

- active IOCs for the selected actor
- source and source URL
- confidence, TLP, first/last seen, malware family, campaign, tags, and evidence
- ATT&CK technique IDs found in IOC metadata, feed records, OTX pulses, or uploaded reports
- actions to add IOC-linked TTPs to `My TTPs` or show them on the matrix
- CSV export for client handoff or downstream tooling

The global **IOC Library** page at `/ioc-library` provides:

- full IOC search across indicator value, source, malware family, campaign, and
  description
- filters for IOC type, source, and group/attacker
- sorting by last seen, first seen, type, indicator, source, confidence, or
  group/attacker
- custom JSON/CSV/TXT feed connection and per-source sync
- MISP JSON export connection as a custom IOC source
- filtered STIX 2.1 export for IOC handoff to OpenCTI or other CTI platforms
- STIX bundle import and TAXII collection pull for source-backed IOC ingestion
- per-IOC detail pages with source metadata, raw enrichment values, mapped TTPs,
  actor links, and clickable pivots back into the matrix, actor library,
  source reports, and IOC search
- per-IOC VirusTotal check button with found ATT&CK TTPs, actor matches, and
  matrix / `My TTPs` actions

The **IOC Investigation** page at `/ioc-investigation` is the v3.0 workflow for
starting from one artifact and expanding context:

- classify the input as IP, domain, URL, hash, or generic artifact
- collect local source-backed evidence and configured enrichment-source results
- expand Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 relationships
- save, reopen, and delete previous investigations
- focus the relationship graph on any node and open node detail pages for follow-up pivots
- rank source evidence, show next-best pivots, extract timeline context, and flag source conflicts
- analyze urlscan activity for suspicious URL, redirect, payload, and infrastructure patterns
- extract ATT&CK technique leads and actor/APT leads from source metadata
- summarize kill-chain/tactic coverage and suspicion score
- optionally send the collected evidence to a configured LLM for a concise
  analyst summary
- show discovered TTPs on Navigator, add them to `My TTPs`, search IOC Library,
  or continue in VirusTotal Lookup

IOC types are normalized during import and enrichment. Provider labels such as
`sha256_hash`, `filehash-sha256`, `sha1_hash`, and `md5_hash` are folded into
`sha256`, `sha1`, and `md5` so hash counts and filters stay consistent.

IOC-to-TTP mapping uses this priority order:

1. strict source/report evidence, where an uploaded report, STIX/TAXII object,
   MISP/custom record, or explicit feed field contains an ATT&CK technique ID
2. enrichment-platform evidence, where ThreatFox, OTX, Malpedia, VirusTotal,
   sandbox, Sigma/YARA, or other metadata contains ATT&CK technique IDs
3. optional AI fallback, used only when enabled for sync/enrichment and no
   strict or platform TTP evidence was found

Use **Enrich IOC TTPs** in IOC Library or Feeds Management to reprocess the
local IOC database. To allow AI fallback during a sync, enable the AI checkbox in
the UI or pass `ai_enrich=true&ai_provider=local|claude|openai|gemini|minimax` to
`/api/sync/ioc`, `/api/ioc/sync/threatfox`, `/api/ioc/sync/otx`, or
`/api/ioc/sync/{source_id}`.

### Sigma / YARA Rule Feeds

Detection Studio can connect external Sigma and YARA rule feeds from the
Pipeline page. Supported feed URLs are:

- a raw `.yml`, `.yaml`, `.yar`, or `.yara` rule file
- a text or JSON URL that contains rule URLs
- a GitHub tree URL such as `https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/tree/master/rules`
- the default public Yara-Rules malware tree: `https://github.com/Yara-Rules/rules/tree/master/malware`

Use **Pipeline -> Detections -> Connect Sigma / YARA Rule Feeds** to add the
default SigmaHQ feed, the public Yara-Rules malware feed, or a private rule repository. Sync imports matching rules
into Detection Studio as `DetectionVersion` records. Imported rules keep their
source URL in validation metadata and are mapped to ATT&CK when the rule text or
Sigma tags contain technique IDs.

Detection Studio can also generate controlled YARA-L skeletons for Chronicle /
Google SecOps-style detection engineering handoff. YARA-L output is generated as
analyst-review content and keeps the same placeholder warning model as Sigma,
YARA, KQL, SPL, and EQL.

For detection authoring, use **Pipeline -> Detections -> Generate Detection
Rule**. The generator supports deterministic skeleton mode and optional
AI-assisted mode through local, Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, or MiniMax providers.
Paste report excerpts, behavior notes, log-source constraints, or false-positive
notes into the context field. AI output is stored as a detection version and
must still be reviewed before production use.

API:

```text
POST /api/pipeline/rule-feeds/defaults
POST /api/pipeline/sources
POST /api/pipeline/sources/{source_id}/run
GET  /api/pipeline/detections/versions
```

### Sandbox Behavior Enrichment

The Pipeline **Sandbox** tab connects sandbox behavior feeds and stores report
output as observable enrichment. This is intended for private CAPE/Cuckoo
exports, ANY.RUN-style gateway exports, internal detonation systems, or a JSON
feed generated by your own malware lab.

Supported feed shape:

- a JSON array of sandbox reports
- a JSON object with `reports`, `data`, `results`, `analyses`, `items`, or
  `tasks`
- a single sandbox report object

The parser extracts sample hashes, verdict, score, malware family, tags,
behavior signatures, process names/command lines, network artifacts, and ATT&CK
technique IDs found anywhere in the report. Each report creates or updates a
hash observable and attaches a `sandbox:<feed name>` enrichment record.

API:

```text
POST /api/pipeline/sources        # kind=sandbox
POST /api/pipeline/sources/{source_id}/run
GET  /api/pipeline/sandbox/behaviors
```

API:

```text
GET  /api/ioc/sources
GET  /api/ioc/library?search=apt&type=sha256&actor=G0006&sort=last_seen_desc
GET  /api/ioc/library/export/stix?search=apt&type=sha256&limit=5000
POST /api/ioc/sources
POST /api/sync/ioc?days=7
POST /api/ioc/sync/threatfox?days=7
POST /api/ioc/sync/malpedia

GET  /api/ioc/actors/G0049?days=180&active_only=true
GET  /api/ioc/actors/G0049/summary?days=180
GET  /api/ioc/actors/G0049/export.csv?days=180&active_only=true
```

Custom JSON/CSV records can use these fields:

```text
value, type, actor_attack_id, actor_name, malware_family, campaign,
technique_ids, source_url, first_seen, last_seen, confidence, tlp, tags, description
```

TXT feeds are treated as one IOC per line with best-effort type inference.

### VirusTotal Lookup — On-Demand IOC Context

VirusTotal Lookup checks one IOC at a time and does not persist the VirusTotal
response. Configure `VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY` in `.env`, then open `/virustotal` in
the Docker frontend.

Supported inputs:

- IP address
- domain
- URL
- MD5, SHA1, or SHA256

The page displays verdict counts, community votes, selected engine detections,
object names, tags, threat labels, crowdsourced YARA/IDS/Sigma rules, sandbox
verdicts, DNS/WHOIS/network metadata, and ATT&CK IDs found in VirusTotal
context. TTP matches include source evidence from VT object attributes or
behavior MITRE trees.

Local actor matching checks ATT&CK group names and aliases against VT threat
labels, tags, filenames, crowdsourced rule text, sandbox verdicts, malware
configuration, and behavior context. Matched actors include evidence showing
which VT field produced the match.

Actions:

- add found TTPs to `My TTPs`
- show found TTPs on the matrix
- open a matched adversary page
- overlay a matched adversary on the matrix
- add the matched adversary's TTPs to the working set

campaigns, group-technique relationships, campaign-technique relationships,
campaign-group attribution links, and STIX external references.

The daily dynamic DB sync runs through Celery Beat at
`DYNAMIC_DB_SYNC_HOUR:DYNAMIC_DB_SYNC_MINUTE` UTC. It refreshes public/reference
data and feed-backed IOC enrichment while preserving private report sessions,
manual imports, and custom/private feed records in the external Postgres data
directory.

### Health

## Configuration

All configuration is via environment variables in `.env`.

| Variable | Default | Description |

### Makefile shortcuts

```bash
make up           # docker compose up --build
make down         # stop and remove containers
make logs         # follow api + worker logs
make shell-api    # bash into the api container
make shell-db     # psql into postgres
make ingest       # trigger ATT&CK re-ingestion manually
make reset        # tear down volumes and rebuild from scratch (destructive)
```

### Running tests

```bash
# Inside the api container (real PostgreSQL):
docker compose exec api pytest tests/ -v

# Locally (unit tests, no DB):
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
PYTHONPATH=. pytest tests/unit/ -v
```

### Database schema and migrations

AdversaryGraph uses SQLAlchemy `create_all()` on startup — no migration framework required for a fresh install.

If upgrading an existing deployment, apply these `ALTER TABLE` statements manually:

```sql
-- v0.2.1: stores the ATT&CK domain used for each analysis session
ALTER TABLE analysis_sessions
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS domain VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'enterprise-attack';

-- v0.3.0: user-defined label for each report session
ALTER TABLE analysis_sessions
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS name VARCHAR(255);

-- v0.3.0: campaigns, campaign-technique links, campaign-group attribution
-- (created automatically by create_all() if tables don't exist)
-- If upgrading a v0.2.x DB, restart the API container and it will create them.
```

### Adding a new LLM provider

1. Create `backend/app/services/ai/myprovider.py` extending `LLMAdapter`:

```python
class MyProviderAdapter(LLMAdapter):
    def __init__(self, model: str = "my-model") -> None:
        self._model = model
        self._api_client = MySDK(api_key=settings.my_provider_api_key)

    @property
    def provider(self) -> str: return "myprovider"

    @property
    def model(self) -> str: return self._model

    async def _raw_complete(self, system: str, user: str) -> str: ...
    async def _stream_complete(self, system: str, user: str) -> AsyncIterator[str]: ...
```

2. Register in `factory.py`
3. Add to `ALLOWED_PROVIDERS` in `analyze.py`
4. Add to the frontend provider dropdowns in `Analyze.tsx` and `LLMChat.tsx`

---

## Deployment

### Production and Security Note

AdversaryGraph is suitable for local labs, private analyst workstations, internal CTI workflows, and controlled self-hosted deployments. Internet-facing deployments require additional access control and hardening.

### Security checklist

- [ ] Set a strong `DB_PASS` in `.env`
- [ ] Set a strong `REDIS_PASSWORD` in `.env`
- [ ] Never commit `.env` to git (it is in `.gitignore`)
- [ ] Do not expose PostgreSQL publicly; bind it to an internal network or localhost only
- [ ] Protect the API with a VPN, SSO, OAuth proxy, authenticating reverse proxy, or internal network controls
- [ ] For reverse-proxy auth, set `AUTH_ENABLED=true`, set `PROXY_SECRET`, and configure the proxy to strip client-supplied `X-Auth-User`, `X-Auth-Roles`, and `X-Internal-Proxy-Secret` before setting trusted values
- [ ] Use TLS for browser and API traffic
- [ ] Restrict CORS to approved origins
- [ ] Use strong, unique secrets and rotate LLM API keys regularly
- [ ] Configure PostgreSQL backups, restore testing, retention, and deletion controls
- [ ] For any internet-facing deployment, place AdversaryGraph behind nginx or Caddy with TLS and authentication
- [ ] Review trusted-header authentication and role configuration before team deployment
- [ ] API keys are read from environment variables and never stored in the database

### Scaling

- The API runs a single uvicorn worker by default. For concurrent users add `--workers 4` in `docker-compose.yml`.
- Celery workers scale horizontally — add additional `worker` service instances.
- The PostgreSQL connection pool is set to 10 connections (max 20 overflow).

Native MITRE ATLAS matrix ingestion is now integrated with the Docker sync pipeline beside Enterprise, Mobile, and ICS ATT&CK. The embedded Anomaly Detection Atlas reference book remains a separate 1200km research corpus.

### v0.5.0 (2026-06-12)

**Public intelligence and ecosystem release:**
- AdversaryGraph Web promoted as the public intelligence workspace and primary ecosystem entry point
- Permanent crawlable actor and technique pages generated from the current public-workspace dataset
- Global actor, alias, technique, report, publisher, and evidence search
- Intelligence discovery dashboard, shareable deep links, report filtering, and event-level Google Analytics
- Correlated CTI/IR reports, defensive guidance, threat hunting, evidence assessment, and detection coverage workflows
- Strong cross-links to AdversaryGraph docs, CTI Analyst Field Manual, Israel Threat Actors CTI, Anomaly Detection Atlas, ITDR Handbook, and 1200km Medium research

### v0.4.0 (2026-06-11)

**Group vs Group comparison:**
- New **Group vs Group** page (sidebar → ◉ Group vs Group): compare up to 6 ATT&CK group profiles simultaneously
- **Overlap Matrix** tab — N×N Jaccard similarity table; pairwise shared-technique cards with amber badges
- **ATT&CK View** tab — compact combined matrix filtered to techniques used by ≥ 1 selected group; each cell shows coloured dots for every group that uses the technique
- **Technique Table** tab — sortable by ID or per-group column, filterable (All / Shared 2+ / Exclusive), ✓ checkmarks per group, count column

**Clickable TTP detail panels:**
- Every technique ID throughout the UI is now a clickable link — click to open a slide-in detail panel
- Panel shows: technique name and ID, tactics, platforms, full description, detection guidance, Anomaly Detection Atlas cross-references, Ecosystem Resources section
- **Ecosystem Resources** links: Anomaly Detection Atlas (per-technique deep links), ITDR Handbook (auto-linked for identity techniques: T1078, T1098, T1110, T1111, T1136, T1531, T1539, T1550, T1552, T1555, T1556, T1558, T1606, T1621), CTI Analyst Field Manual, AdversaryGraph Web Tool
- Wired in: Navigator matrix cells, ATT&CK Group Library technique list, Compare (shared/gap/overview badges), Group vs Group (overlap badges and technique table)
- Close with **Esc** or click outside

**Ecosystem integration:**
- Sidebar links added: AdversaryGraph Web Tool (no-Docker browser version), CTI Knowledge Base, 1200km.com
- Anomaly Detection Atlas links now point to `https://1200km.com/anomaly-detection-atlas` (previously `localhost`) — works without running the full Docker stack

### v0.3.0 (2026-06-06)

**Two-database architecture:**
- Added `Campaign`, `CampaignTechnique`, `AptGroupCampaign` SQLAlchemy models
- STIX ingestor parses `campaign` objects and `attributed-to` / `uses` relationships from the selected ATT&CK release
- New API endpoints:
  - `GET /api/apt/campaigns` — list all campaigns, filterable by domain, group, search, version
  - `GET /api/apt/campaigns/{attack_id}` — full campaign detail with technique list
  - `POST /api/apt/campaigns/compare` — Jaccard ranking vs all campaigns (body: `{technique_ids: [...]}`)
  - `GET /api/analyze/sessions` — DB 2 report library (all completed analysis sessions)
  - `POST /api/analyze/sessions/{id}/compare` — re-run Jaccard for a stored report
- `AnalysisSession` gains `name VARCHAR(255)` column; name is set from the `name` form field or filename
- **ATT&CK Group Library** — Campaigns tab per group: expandable campaign cards with technique list, date range, "Add to my TTPs" action
- **Compare page** — three-mode switcher: Groups (DB 1) / Campaigns (DB 1) / Reports (DB 2)

**Bug fix:**
- `GET /api/analyze/sessions` was shadowed by `GET /api/analyze/{session_id}` because the wildcard route was registered first; fixed by reordering routes so static paths precede parameterised ones

### v0.2.1 (2026-06-06)

**Security fixes:**
- File uploads streamed with 64 KB chunk reader; 50 MB guard fires before entire body is buffered
- `/apt/compare` enforces max 500 technique IDs
- `ChatRequest.context` capped at 8,000 characters; `model` validated against pattern
- `_parse_response` uses `json.JSONDecoder().raw_decode()` — greedy regex replaced

**Correctness fixes:**
- Failed post-stream DB writes now set `status=failed` correctly
- `AnalysisSession` gains `domain` column; PDF exports show the actual analysis domain
- `GET /analyze/{id}` returns `JSONResponse(status_code=202)` instead of raising `HTTPException(202)`
- Layer PDF technique count derived from DB results, not raw client-supplied IDs

**Performance:**
- Anthropic, OpenAI-compatible, and Gemini SDK clients cached in `__init__`; connection pools reused across requests

### v0.2.0 (2026-06-06)

- Initial release: Navigator, AI Analysis, ATT&CK Group Library, Compare, Export, MITRE Sync
- STIX bundle parsing rewritten to use stdlib `json` only (Python 3.12, drops `mitreattack-python`)
- Fixed tactic matrix ordering: canonical ATT&CK kill-chain sort
