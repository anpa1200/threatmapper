# AdversaryGraph

![AdversaryGraph AI banner](docs/assets/adversarygraph-ai-banner.png)

**Self-hosted AI-assisted CTI-to-detection workbench for ATT&CK mapping, IOC enrichment, malware-analysis triage, asset attack-surface review, Attack Simulation, and SIEM validation.**

Current release: **v5.0.0**. See the [version matrix](docs/version-matrix.md), [release summary](docs/release-summary-v5.0.0.md), and [published v5 article](https://medium.com/@1200km/adversarygraph-v5-0-from-cti-mapping-to-attack-simulation-and-siem-validation-21873b2a6c39).

## What It Does

AdversaryGraph helps analysts turn threat reports, IOC evidence, malware-analysis leads, asset inventories, and validation telemetry into reviewed ATT&CK/ATLAS mappings and detection engineering work items.

Core capabilities:

- AI-assisted report ingestion from text, PDF, DOCX, and TXT.
- ATT&CK/ATLAS Navigator with actor, campaign, sector, and comparison overlays.
- IOC Library, IOC Investigation pivots, VirusTotal lookup, and feed management.
- Asset Attack Surface Mapping from CMDB, scanner, cloud, CSV, JSON, and hostname/IP inventories.
- Malware Analysis workflow backed by the isolated MalwareGraph service for static triage, strings, unpacking/deobfuscation support, debugger-style review, and AI summaries.
- Attack Simulation for TTP-first lab scenarios, real attacked-server telemetry, SIEM forwarding, coherent AI-assisted kill-chain drills, and attack-chain graph review.
- Operations, Pipeline, detection backlog, investigation reports, exports, and API workflows.

## What It Is Not

AdversaryGraph is not a managed SaaS, not a multi-tenant security platform, and not a replacement for analyst validation. LLM mappings, generated detections, actor similarity, malware-analysis findings, and synthetic SIEM telemetry are analyst-assistance outputs.

Attack Simulation has two different telemetry modes:

- **Real lab telemetry:** produced by approved Docker lab fixtures such as `attack-lab-web` and `attack-lab-endpoint`.
- **Synthetic AI telemetry:** source-shaped events generated for SIEM parser/rule exercises. This validates field handling and correlation logic, not real exploit behavior.

See [Validation and Limitations](docs/validation-and-limitations.md), [Attack Simulation](docs/attack-simulation.md), and [SIEM forwarding security](docs/attack-simulation-siem-forwarding-security.md).

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anpa1200/adversarygraph.git
cd adversarygraph
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and set strong local secrets. Add at least one LLM provider key, or configure a local OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
./scripts/selftest.sh
```

Open:

- Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
- API health: `http://localhost:8000/api/health`
- API docs: `http://localhost:8000/docs`

The default Compose deployment binds the public UI and reference docs to localhost and keeps the API, Redis, malware-analysis service, and lab fixtures on the internal Compose network.

## Architecture

```text
React frontend
  -> FastAPI API
     -> PostgreSQL for stored analyses, cases, feeds, mappings, and operations
     -> Redis/Celery for background sync and analysis jobs
     -> LLM providers selected by the operator
     -> MalwareGraph service for isolated malware-analysis workflows
     -> Attack lab fixtures for authorized simulation telemetry
```

The main platform stores structured CTI and workflow data. Malware samples are handled by the MalwareGraph boundary. Attack Simulation lab targets are separate fixture containers so telemetry comes from the target class being tested.

## Safety Boundaries

- Do not upload confidential data to public demos.
- Do not expose the default Compose stack directly to the internet.
- Use TLS, authentication, restricted networks, backups, monitoring, and secret rotation for controlled production deployments.
- Treat LLM output and generated detections as untrusted until reviewed.
- Use only approved lab targets for Attack Simulation.
- Keep malware runtime execution in disposable isolated profiles only.

## Validation

Local validation commands:

```bash
./scripts/check-version-consistency.sh
docker compose config --quiet
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml config --quiet
cd backend && PYTHONPATH=. DB_PASS=ci_test_password LOG_DIR=/tmp/adversarygraph-test-logs python -m pytest
cd frontend && npm ci && npm run build && npm audit --audit-level=high
```

CI runs backend tests, backend lint, backend dependency audit, frontend build, frontend dependency audit, Docker Compose validation, Docker image builds, container scanning, secret scanning, and version consistency checks.
