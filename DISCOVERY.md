# AdversaryGraph And CTI Publishing Kit

Use this file for consistent external publishing of AdversaryGraph and the related
1200km CTI ecosystem. The core message is CTI-to-detection, not automated
attribution.

## One-Line Pitch

AdversaryGraph is an AI-assisted CTI-to-detection workbench that turns threat
reports into ATT&CK mappings, TTP-overlap comparisons, Navigator-style views,
detection gaps, and analyst-ready outputs.

## Short Description

AdversaryGraph helps analysts operationalize CTI. It extracts ATT&CK technique
candidates from reports, keeps supporting evidence visible, compares selected
TTPs against known groups and campaigns, surfaces detection gaps, and exports
analyst-ready outputs. The web version is a public browser workspace for ATT&CK
exploration. The Docker version adds self-hosted AI extraction, private
PostgreSQL-backed analyses, APIs, and report generation.

## Safety And Accuracy Statement

AdversaryGraph does not perform definitive attribution. TTP overlap and group
similarity are investigation leads for analyst review, not proof of actor
identity. LLM-assisted extraction can produce false positives, false negatives,
or ambiguous technique mappings; analysts must validate every mapping against
the source evidence and ATT&CK definitions.

Title:

```text
Show HN: AdversaryGraph - CTI reports to ATT&CK mappings and detection gaps
```

Body:

```text
I built AdversaryGraph to reduce the manual gap between threat reports and
detection engineering.

The workflow is:
report/PDF/text -> ATT&CK technique candidates with evidence -> group/campaign
TTP-overlap comparison -> Navigator-style layer -> detection gaps -> analyst
report.

There are two modes:
- public browser workspace for ATT&CK exploration and group comparison
- self-hosted Docker platform for AI-assisted report extraction, private
  PostgreSQL-backed analyses, APIs, and PDF reports

It is not an attribution engine. TTP overlap is an investigation lead, and every
LLM-assisted mapping needs analyst validation.

### Reddit r/threatintel

```text
I built AdversaryGraph as a CTI-to-detection workflow tool and would appreciate
feedback from CTI analysts.

The goal is not automated attribution. The goal is to make the mechanical part
of report processing easier: extract ATT&CK technique candidates, preserve
supporting evidence, compare TTP overlap with groups/campaigns, identify
detection gaps, and export analyst-ready outputs.

### Reddit r/blueteamsec

```text
I released AdversaryGraph, a CTI-to-detection workbench focused on turning threat
reports into detection backlog material.

It maps report evidence to ATT&CK technique candidates, compares TTP overlap
with groups and campaigns, surfaces gaps, and produces Navigator-style views and
analyst reports. The public web version is browser-native; the Docker version
adds self-hosted AI extraction and private analysis storage.

The important constraint: it is not an attribution engine. The output is
analyst-review seed material for hunting and detection engineering.

CTI should not stop at a PDF.

I built AdversaryGraph to help move from threat reports to detection-ready work:

1. ingest report text/PDF/DOCX
2. extract ATT&CK technique candidates with evidence
3. compare TTP overlap with groups and campaigns
4. generate Navigator-style views
5. identify detection gaps
6. export analyst-ready reports

AdversaryGraph does not perform definitive attribution. TTP overlap is an
investigation lead, and every mapping requires analyst validation.

1/ I built AdversaryGraph: a CTI-to-detection workbench for turning threat reports
into ATT&CK mappings, TTP-overlap comparisons, and detection gaps.

2/ Workflow:
report -> evidence -> ATT&CK technique candidates -> group/campaign comparison
-> Navigator-style layer -> analyst report.

3/ Public web mode is browser-native. Docker mode adds self-hosted AI
extraction, private PostgreSQL-backed analyses, APIs, and PDF reports.

4/ Important limitation: AdversaryGraph is not an attribution engine. TTP overlap
is an investigation lead, not proof.

### OpenCTI Community

```text
I built AdversaryGraph as a CTI-to-detection workbench around ATT&CK evidence
mapping, group/campaign TTP-overlap comparison, detection gaps, and analyst
reporting. It complements OpenCTI-style workflows by helping analysts turn raw
reports into structured ATT&CK hypotheses before promotion into a CTI knowledge
graph.

### MISP Community

```text
AdversaryGraph is a CTI-to-detection workbench for analyst-reviewed ATT&CK mapping
and detection-gap analysis. It is not a MISP replacement; the useful integration
angle is turning report evidence into structured technique hypotheses and
observable context that can later feed MISP/OpenCTI-style workflows.

```

### Sigma / Detection Engineering Communities

```text
AdversaryGraph focuses on the step before rule writing: turning CTI report
evidence into ATT&CK technique candidates, hunting hypotheses, detection gaps,
and analyst-reviewed backlog items. It is intended to feed Sigma/KQL/SPL work,
not replace detection engineering validation.

Subject:

```text
AdversaryGraph: CTI reports to ATT&CK mapping and detection backlog
```

Body:

```text
Hi,

I released AdversaryGraph, an open-source CTI-to-detection workbench for mapping
threat reports to MITRE ATT&CK, comparing TTP overlap with known groups and
campaigns, identifying detection gaps, and exporting analyst-ready outputs.

The project is explicitly analyst-controlled: it does not perform definitive
attribution, and TTP overlap is treated as an investigation lead rather than
proof. The public web version supports browser-native ATT&CK exploration; the
self-hosted Docker version adds AI-assisted extraction, private analysis
storage, APIs, and PDF reporting.
