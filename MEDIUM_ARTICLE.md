# ThreatMapper: I Built a Self-Hosted AI Threat Intelligence Platform — Here's How to Use It

*Map adversary behaviour to MITRE ATT&CK in seconds, compare against 160+ APT groups, and generate PDF reports — all running locally with your own LLM keys.*

---

## The Problem

Every threat intelligence analyst knows the workflow: you receive a malware report, an IR summary, or a threat feed entry, and you need to translate it into ATT&CK technique IDs so you can slot it into a detection backlog or a purple-team plan.

Doing this manually is slow. You read the report, recognise a behaviour ("the implant used scheduled tasks for persistence"), pull up the ATT&CK website, search for the technique, copy the ID. Repeat 20 times for a single report. Then someone asks: *"Does this look like APT29?"* — and you start manually cross-referencing technique lists.

There are commercial platforms that do this — but they are expensive, require data to leave your environment, and often treat ATT&CK as a secondary feature behind proprietary kill-chains.

**ThreatMapper** is my attempt to solve this for analysts who want a self-hosted, privacy-first, open-source option that uses the LLM API keys they already have.

## What ThreatMapper Does

In one sentence: **you give it a threat report, it gives you ATT&CK technique IDs, APT group matches, confidence scores, and a PDF.**

Concretely:

- **AI Analysis** — upload a PDF, DOCX, or TXT file (or paste text), pick Claude, GPT-4o, or Gemini, and get a streamed extraction of every ATT&CK technique the LLM identifies with evidence snippets and confidence scores
- **ATT&CK Navigator** — an interactive heatmap of the full ATT&CK matrix (Enterprise, Mobile, ICS) where you build and explore your TTP layer
- **APT Attribution** — automatic Jaccard similarity ranking of every extraction against 160+ named ATT&CK threat groups
- **Compare** — deep side-by-side comparison of your TTP set against any group: visual matrix diff, tactic breakdown chart, and gap analysis
- **Export** — ATT&CK Navigator-compatible JSON layers and multi-page PDF reports suitable for executive briefings

Everything runs locally in Docker. Your threat reports never leave your machine.

---

## Architecture in Brief

ThreatMapper is four containers:

```
React / Vite frontend  ←→  FastAPI backend  ←→  PostgreSQL
                                  ↕
                           Redis + Celery
                        (background jobs, daily ATT&CK sync)
```

The backend ingests ATT&CK STIX 2.1 bundles directly from MITRE's GitHub repository using pure Python — no third-party ATT&CK library, fully compatible with Python 3.12. All three ATT&CK domains (Enterprise, Mobile, ICS) are parsed and stored in PostgreSQL with JSONB arrays for the STIX arrays.

LLM calls go directly from the FastAPI backend to Anthropic / OpenAI / Google using their official SDKs. Your API keys never touch a third-party service beyond the LLM provider itself.

---

## Setting Up (10 Minutes)

### Prerequisites

- Docker + Docker Compose
- An API key for at least one of: Anthropic (Claude), OpenAI, Google Gemini

### Step 1: Clone and configure

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anpa1200/threatmapper.git
cd threatmapper
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and add your keys. You only need one:

```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
# OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
# GEMINI_API_KEY=AIza...

DB_PASS=choose_a_strong_password
```

If you want a faster first start and only need Enterprise ATT&CK, set:

```env
ATTCK_DOMAINS=enterprise-attack
```

This downloads ~35 MB instead of ~105 MB.

### Step 2: Start

```bash
docker compose up
```

The first start downloads and ingests ATT&CK data automatically. Watch progress:

```bash
docker compose logs -f api
```

You'll see something like:

```
Parsing enterprise-attack-16.1.json ...
  Parsed: 14 tactics, 641 techniques, 163 groups, 8234 usages
Finished ingesting enterprise-attack v16.1
INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

This takes 5–15 minutes depending on your network speed. Subsequent startups are instant (data is cached).

### Step 3: Open

- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- API docs (Swagger UI): http://localhost:8000/docs

## Core Workflow: Analysing a Threat Report

This is the killer feature and what most analysts will use day-to-day.

### Upload your report

Navigate to **Analyze** in the sidebar. You'll see:

1. A provider dropdown (Claude / GPT-4o / Gemini)
2. An optional model override (defaults to `claude-opus-4-8`, `gpt-4o`, `gemini-2.0-flash`)
3. A domain selector (`enterprise-attack` for most corporate IR work)
4. A text area or file upload

For a PDF analysis report:

1. Select **Claude** (or your preferred provider)
2. Leave the domain as `enterprise-attack`
3. Click **Choose file** and upload your PDF
4. Click **Analyse with AI**

You'll immediately see the LLM's response streaming in the output box — token by token, just like ChatGPT. This is not a spinner that makes you wait: you can read the thinking as it happens.

### Reading the results

When the stream completes, three tabs appear:

**Techniques tab** — the core output. Each row shows:

| Field | Example |
|---|---|
| ATT&CK ID | T1059.001 |
| Name | PowerShell |
| Tactic | Execution |
| Confidence | 92% |
| Evidence | *"executed a base64-encoded PowerShell payload"* |

The evidence field is a direct quote or paraphrase from your source document — you can use it to trace every mapping back to its origin in the text. High confidence (≥ 80%) means the text explicitly described the behaviour; lower scores mean it was inferred.

**APT Matches tab** — the attribution layer. This is computed locally using Jaccard similarity between your extracted techniques and every named ATT&CK group's known TTP set. The top 10 are shown with:

- Similarity score (0–100%)
- Shared technique count
- List of the overlapping technique IDs

A match above 30% is worth investigating. Don't treat this as definitive attribution — use it as a lead for further research.

**Raw Response** — the LLM's full JSON output. Useful for debugging when the model outputs something unexpected.

### Inject into Navigator

Click **→ Inject into Navigator** to push all extracted techniques into your live Navigator layer. You can then:

- See the techniques highlighted on the full ATT&CK matrix
- Overlay an APT group to visualise the behavioural overlap
- Export as an ATT&CK Navigator JSON layer

---

## The Navigator: Your ATT&CK Workspace

The Navigator is the central hub. It renders the full ATT&CK matrix as an interactive heatmap with D3.js zoom/pan.

### Building a layer

Click any technique cell to add it to your layer (it turns red). Click again to deselect. For sub-techniques, click the small ▶ arrow to expand the parent cell and see the sub-technique rows.

**Practical tip:** use the search box to find techniques by name or ID without manually scanning the matrix. Type `T1059` to jump to all Command and Scripting Interpreter techniques, or type `phish` to find all phishing-related techniques.

### Overlaying an APT group

1. Go to **APT Library** and find your group of interest
2. Click **Overlay on Navigator**
3. Return to **Navigator**

The matrix now uses three colours:
- **Red** — in your layer only
- **Blue** — in the APT group's profile only
- **Amber** — in both (the overlap)

This visual immediately answers: *"Which of this group's known techniques am I not already detecting?"*

### Importing an existing layer

If you already have ATT&CK Navigator layers from previous work, click **↑ Import layer** and upload the JSON. ThreatMapper will load it as your active layer, which you can then enrich with AI analysis or compare against APT groups.

---

## APT Attribution Deep-Dive: The Compare View

The Compare view is where ThreatMapper earns its name for attribution work.

### Running a comparison

With techniques selected in Navigator (or injected from an AI analysis), navigate to **Compare**. The left panel immediately shows all ATT&CK groups ranked by Jaccard similarity with your current layer.

Click any group to open the four-tab detail view.

### What each tab tells you

**Overview** — numbers first. You see the similarity score, how many techniques you share, and two chip groups: techniques in both sets (amber) and techniques only in your layer (red). This answers the question: *"How much of our observed behaviour matches this group's known playbook?"*

**Tactic Breakdown** — a stacked bar chart with one bar per kill-chain tactic. Each bar is divided into three segments: shared, yours-only, and APT-only. This view reveals *where* in the kill chain the overlap is concentrated. If you share 5 techniques in lateral movement but none in initial access, that's information about what you may have missed in the early stages.

**Visual Diff** — a compact colour-strip rendering of the full ATT&CK matrix showing the overlap. This is the best view for presentations — it makes the comparison immediately legible to a non-technical stakeholder.

**Gap Analysis** — a flat list of every technique in the APT group's known profile that you have not yet observed or selected. This is your detection backlog: what additional rules or hunts would you need to fully cover this group's known tradecraft?

### Practical attribution workflow

1. Run AI analysis on your incident data
2. Inject extracted techniques into Navigator
3. Open Compare
4. Look for groups with similarity > 25%
5. For each candidate group, review the Gap Analysis tab — does the group use techniques that would be consistent with the parts of the attack you haven't fully characterised yet?
6. Download the PDF report for your findings

---

## Generating Reports

ThreatMapper generates two types of PDF reports.

### Analysis report

From the **Analyze** page, after a completed analysis, click **Download PDF**. The report is formatted for sharing with management or a client and includes:

- Cover page with provider, model, domain, session ID, and timestamp
- Executive summary (the AI-generated TL;DR)
- Extracted techniques table sorted by confidence descending
- APT attribution section with the top 10 Jaccard matches
- Tactic coverage breakdown showing how the techniques distribute across the kill chain

### Navigator layer report

From the **Navigator**, click **↓ PDF** in the toolbar. This generates a lighter report listing all techniques in your current layer with their ATT&CK IDs, tactics, and platforms — useful as a rapid deliverable for a purple-team session or a detection engineering sprint.

---

## Using the AI Chat Assistant

Every technique in the detail panel has an embedded AI chat. This is not a generic chatbot — it is a threat intelligence assistant with the full ATT&CK description of the selected technique already in context.

**Practical prompts that work well:**

For detection engineering:
> *"Write a SIGMA rule for detecting this technique on Windows via Sysmon events"*

For understanding evasion:
> *"How do attackers modify this technique to avoid common detections?"*

For hunting:
> *"What should I look for in Windows Security event logs to hunt for this technique? Give me specific event IDs and field values."*

For red teaming context:
> *"Which tools in the open-source red team ecosystem implement this technique?"*

For correlation:
> *"Which techniques are commonly chained with this one in post-exploitation workflows?"*

The **context** field at the bottom of the chat lets you paste additional information — for example, a log snippet or a list of technique IDs from your current investigation. This gives the assistant grounding in your specific situation. The context field accepts up to 8,000 characters.

---

## Working with All Three ATT&CK Domains

ThreatMapper supports Enterprise, Mobile, and ICS ATT&CK out of the box.

Switch domains using the **Domain** dropdown in the Navigator toolbar or the Analyze page.

**Enterprise ATT&CK** — 641 techniques, 163 groups. Use for traditional IT infrastructure incidents: Windows/Linux/macOS endpoints, cloud workloads, Active Directory environments.

**Mobile ATT&CK** — covers Android and iOS threat behaviours. Useful for incidents involving mobile device management (MDM) bypass, spyware, or mobile-targeting APT campaigns.

**ICS ATT&CK** — covers operational technology and industrial control systems. Use for incidents involving SCADA, PLCs, HMIs, or critical infrastructure.

Each domain has its own set of tactics, techniques, and APT groups. When you run an AI analysis, select the appropriate domain so the Jaccard comparison runs against groups known for activity in that domain.

---

## API Usage (Headless / CI Integration)

ThreatMapper exposes a full REST API. You can drive the entire workflow programmatically.

### Analyse a report via API

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/analyze \
  -F "provider=claude" \
  -F "domain=enterprise-attack" \
  -F "file=@incident_report.pdf" \
  | python -m json.tool
```

Response:

```json
{
  "session_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "provider": "claude",
  "model": "claude-opus-4-8",
  "summary": "The report describes a spearphishing campaign ...",
  "techniques": [
    {
      "attack_id": "T1566.001",
      "name": "Spearphishing Attachment",
      "tactic": "initial-access",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "evidence": "the email contained a malicious Excel attachment"
    }
  ],
  "apt_matches": [
    {
      "group_attack_id": "G0016",
      "group_name": "APT29",
      "similarity": 0.34,
      "shared_count": 8,
      "shared_techniques": ["T1566.001", "T1059.001", ...]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Compare a known technique set via API

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/apt/compare?domain=enterprise-attack&top_n=5" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"technique_ids": ["T1566.001", "T1059.001", "T1078", "T1021.001", "T1003.001"]}' \
  | python -m json.tool
```

### Stream an analysis (Python example)

```python
import httpx, json

with httpx.stream(
    "POST",
    "http://localhost:8000/api/analyze/stream",
    data={"provider": "claude", "domain": "enterprise-attack"},
    files={"file": open("report.pdf", "rb")},
    timeout=300,
) as r:
    for line in r.iter_lines():
        if line.startswith("data: "):
            event = json.loads(line[6:])
            if event["type"] == "token":
                print(event["content"], end="", flush=True)
            elif event["type"] == "result":
                print("\n\nFinal techniques:")
                for t in event["data"]["techniques"]:
                    print(f"  {t['attack_id']} ({t['confidence']*100:.0f}%) — {t['name']}")
            elif event["type"] == "error":
                print(f"\nError: {event['message']}")
```

---

## Keeping ATT&CK Data Fresh

ATT&CK releases new versions periodically (approximately twice a year). ThreatMapper checks for new versions daily at 03:00 UTC via a Celery Beat job.

The sidebar footer shows a pulsing amber indicator when a new version is available. Trigger an update:

```bash
# Quick API call
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/sync/trigger

# Check what version you have vs what's available
curl http://localhost:8000/api/sync/status
```

The sync downloads only the new bundle version and ingests it alongside the existing data without deleting anything. Both versions remain queryable — endpoints accept an optional `?version=16.1` parameter to target a specific release.

---

## Tips for Analysts

**Calibrate your confidence threshold.** I recommend treating < 50% confidence as noise until you validate it manually. The LLM is trying hard to find ATT&CK mappings, which means it will sometimes stretch an inference. Use the evidence snippet to sanity-check every mapping.

**Use the Gap Analysis as a hunt checklist.** When you match against an APT group in Compare, the Gap Analysis tab shows every technique in their known profile that you haven't covered. This is an excellent input for a structured hunt — you're essentially asking *"what would we need to observe to confirm this attribution?"*

**Chain features for maximum value.** The best workflow is: AI Analysis → inject into Navigator → Compare against APT groups → Gap Analysis → export PDF. Each step builds on the last.

**Chat is good for detection rules.** The AI assistant is particularly strong at generating SIGMA rules, KQL queries, and Splunk SPL from ATT&CK technique IDs. Give it the full ATT&CK technique description plus any specific context from your environment (OS, logging stack) and you'll get useful starting points rather than generic templates.

**Import your existing layers.** If your team already maintains ATT&CK Navigator layers for your environment (e.g. a "what we detect" layer and a "what we've seen" layer), import them via the ↑ Import button. ThreatMapper will let you compare them against APT profiles and run AI chat against the techniques in the layer.

**Use text paste for quick triage.** You don't need a formatted document. Paste raw Slack thread text, a SIEM alert body, or a vendor advisory into the text box. The AI is good at extracting signal from noisy, informal text.

## Security Considerations

ThreatMapper is designed for internal/intranet use. It has no built-in authentication — anyone who can reach the Docker network can use it.

**For a team deployment:**

1. Set a strong `DB_PASS` in `.env`
2. Put ThreatMapper behind nginx / Caddy with TLS and HTTP Basic Auth (or integrate with your identity provider via OAuth)
3. Run the Docker containers on an internal network that is not directly internet-accessible
4. The `.env` file containing your LLM API keys should have `chmod 600` and never be committed to git

Your threat intelligence reports are stored in PostgreSQL inside the Docker volume. If you need to comply with data handling policies, deploy ThreatMapper on infrastructure that meets those policies — since it's self-hosted, you retain full control.

---

## What's Coming Next

The tool is functional but there is plenty of room to grow. Things I'm actively thinking about:

- **TAXII/STIX import** — accept threat intelligence directly from TAXII feeds (MISP, OpenCTI, commercial CTI platforms)
- **Saved sessions** — a session library view so you can browse past analyses without knowing the session UUID
- **Team collaboration** — shared TTP layers with user namespacing
- **Detection coverage overlay** — import your existing SIGMA rule library and visualise which ATT&CK techniques you have coverage for vs which are blind spots
- **Automatic APT tracking** — when ATT&CK releases a new version that adds techniques to a group you're tracking, send a notification

---

## Final Thoughts

The core idea behind ThreatMapper is that the heavy lifting of ATT&CK mapping — reading a report, recognising a technique, looking it up, comparing it — is exactly the kind of repetitive, pattern-matching work that LLMs are well-suited for.

The analyst's judgement is still essential: deciding which mappings to trust, what the attribution implications are, what to do about the gap analysis. But the mechanical translation layer — text to ATT&CK IDs — should not take most of your time.

ThreatMapper tries to handle that translation layer so you can spend your time on the interesting parts.
