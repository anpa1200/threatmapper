  personal/private use is free; business, commercial, organizational,
  client-delivery, production, or government use requires prior written

## v2.4.0 - 2026-06-18

- Added daily dynamic reference database synchronization for MITRE ATT&CK,
  MISP Galaxy, and configured IOC intelligence sources.

  `ADVERSARYGRAPH_DB_DIR`, so private reports, custom IOCs, custom feeds, and

  refreshing the dynamic reference database.
- Added a migration helper for moving existing Docker named-volume Postgres data
  into the external deployment directory.

  directory details.

  180-day IOC definition in the group list and actor IOC tab.

  workflow, and IOC count semantics.

## v2.2.0 - 2026-06-18

  deployment checks, self-test commands, log commands, ATT&CK data probes, and
  recovery order.
- Added contextual troubleshooting links to API and startup self-test error
  popups.
- Added a global API error popup with clear HTTP status, request path, and
  message context.
- Added a `Recheck` action on API error popups that reruns the AdversaryGraph
  self-test and turns the popup green with `All correct.` when the deployment
  is healthy.
- Added `/api/system/selftest` and a Docker `selftest` service for validating
  database connectivity, ATT&CK/ATLAS ingestion, and Redis connectivity after
  `docker compose up`.
- Improved startup behavior by retrying matrix data queries and refreshing
  matrix/discover/sync data after self-test passes.
- Documented the v2.2 operational troubleshooting workflow in release notes,
  release summary, quickstart, and full guide examples.

  metadata and ranking actors by client sector, region, environment keywords,
  and activity window.

  confidence/source evidence, and CSV export.

  feeds with actor-aware IOC normalization.
