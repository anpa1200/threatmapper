# Changelog

## v5.3.0 - 2026-06-30

- Promoted active release markers to v5.3.0 across backend, frontend,
  README, roadmap, security policy, version matrix, and release metadata checks.
- Added a local authentication guide page at `/auth-guide` that remains
  reachable before sign-in when native auth is enabled.
- Linked the login page directly to the authentication setup guide.

  workflow during the release update.

## v5.2.0 - 2026-06-30

- Promoted active release markers to v5.2.0 across backend, frontend,
  README, roadmap, security policy, version matrix, and release metadata checks.
- Made backend tests reproducible in a clean local shell by seeding explicit
  test-safe `DB_PASS` and `LOG_DIR` defaults before app settings are imported.
- Added a frontend npm override for Monaco's transitive DOMPurify dependency,
  clearing the frontend audit finding while preserving the decompilation/debug
  editor integration.

- Promoted the active release marker to v5.1.0 across backend, frontend,
  README, roadmap, security policy, and release metadata checks.
- Added the Attack Simulation telemetry fidelity policy: scenarios and
  AI-assisted simulations must use source-correct telemetry and
  vendor/source-shaped event structures, and unsupported TTPs must be reported
  as telemetry gaps instead of generic fake logs.
- Added raw STIX preservation tables for every ingested STIX object and
  relationship while keeping the existing normalized ATT&CK query tables.
- Added CVE Library with NVD CVE API 2.0 and CISA KEV source sync,
  normalized CVE/CVSS score/CWE/CPE storage, strict evidence-backed
  CVE-to-technique/IOC/actor correlation tables, API routes, and a frontend
  CVE review page.

  engineering and SIEM validation review, plus the ATT&CK/STIX and CVE Library
  data models.

  inventories, deterministic exposure/risk scoring, ATT&CK candidate links,
  priority actions, validation gaps, and optional AI-enriched summaries.
- Added saved backend cases for each Asset Surface analysis, with reload and
  delete actions for inventory reviews.
- Added white ATT&CK comparison layers for asset-inventory-derived TTPs so
  inventory findings are visually distinct from manually selected techniques.
- Updated Discover with first-screen launchers for Asset Surface, Malware
  Analysis, String Analyzer, Decompilation and Debug, Malware Unpacker, and
  Dynamic Analysis.
- Fixed sidebar scrolling for long module lists and updated the UI footer,
  backend version, frontend package version, and release documentation to
  v4.1.0.
